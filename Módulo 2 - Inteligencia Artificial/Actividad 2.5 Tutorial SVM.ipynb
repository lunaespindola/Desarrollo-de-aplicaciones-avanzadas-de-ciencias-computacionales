    "# SVM Kernels\n",
    "The SVM algorithm is implemented in practice using a kernel. A kernel transforms an input data space into the required form. SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. Here, the kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. In other words, you can say that it converts nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimension to it. It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick helps you to build a more accurate classifier.\n",

    "* Kernel: The main function of the kernel is to transform the given dataset input data into the required form. There are various types of functions such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF). Polynomial and RBF are useful for non-linear hyperplane. Polynomial and RBF kernels compute the separation line in the higher dimension. In some of the applications, it is suggested to use a more complex kernel to separate the classes that are curved or nonlinear. This transformation can lead to more accurate classifiers.\n",
    "* Regularization: Regularization parameter in python's Scikit-learn C parameter used to maintain regularization. Here C is the penalty parameter, which represents misclassification or error term. The misclassification or error term tells the SVM optimization how much error is bearable. This is how you can control the trade-off between decision boundary and misclassification term. A smaller value of C creates a small-margin hyperplane and a larger value of C creates a larger-margin hyperplane.\n",
    "* Gamma: A lower value of Gamma will loosely fit the training dataset, whereas a higher value of gamma will exactly fit the training dataset, which causes over-fitting. In other words, you can say a low value of gamma considers only nearby points in calculating the separation line, while the a value of gamma considers all the data points in the calculation of the separation line.\n",
    "# Advantages\n",
    "SVM Classifiers offer good accuracy and perform faster prediction compared to NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm. They also use less memory because they use a subset of training points in the decision phase. SVM works well with a clear margin of separation and with high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages\n",
    "SVM is not suitable for large datasets because of its high training time and it also takes more time in training compared to NaÃ¯ve Bayes. It works poorly with overlapping classes and is also sensitive to the type of kernel used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations, you have made it to the end of this tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you covered a lot of ground about Support vector machine algorithm, its working, kernels, hyperparameter tuning, model building and evaluation on breast cancer dataset using the Scikit-learn package. You have also covered its advantages and disadvantages. I hope you have learned something valuable!\n",

    "To learn more about this type of classifiers, you should take a look at our Linear Classifiers in Python course. It introduces other types of regression and loss functions, as well as Support Vector Machines.\n",
