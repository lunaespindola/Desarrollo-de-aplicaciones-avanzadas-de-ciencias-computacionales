In light of the development in computer science and modern technologies, the impersonation crime rate has increased. Consequently, face recognition technology and biometric systems have been employed for security purposes in a variety of applications including human-computer interaction, surveillance systems, etc. Building an advanced sophisticated model to tackle impersonation-related crimes is essential. This study proposes classification Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, utilizing Viola-Jones, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Mutual Information (MI), and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques. The two proposed facial classification systems are J48 with LDA feature extraction method as input, and a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Hybrid Model (1D-CNNHM). The MUCT database was considered for training and evaluation. The performance, in terms of classification, of the J48 model reached 96.01% accuracy whereas the DL model that merged LDA with MI and ANOVA reached 100% accuracy. Comparing the proposed models with other works reflects that they are performing very well, with high accuracy and low processing time.
